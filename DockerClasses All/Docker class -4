DOCKER FILE FOR HTTPD, NGINX AND PYTHON APPLICATION
following below steps to do all those 
code---->Dockerfile----->build this Dockerfile------->image will be created----->if we run the image container will be created

first create one folder name as e-comm-app
go to that folder cd e-com-app
in this e-com-appfolder create file name as index.html and paste the code in this file and save it
SOURCE CODE -------> e-commerce app : https://chat.deepseek.com/share/7avbonbpq9vno81bvj(/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/-------> httpd default path)
search image name as httpd in dockerhub to know the httpd default path
create another file to write Docker file 
file name as vim Dockerfile
in this Dockerfile write Dockerfile components as following below

FROM httpd
LABEL this is e-com app image
MAINTAINER name pranay
EXPOSE 80
COPY index.html /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
(/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/-------> httpd default path)

docker build -t myapp .

docker images

docker run -itd --name e-com -p 1234:80 myapp
docker ps -a
docker ps
copy the public IP of ec2-instance and paste in new tab as public IP:1234 ---------> to access the application with ec2-instance publicIP:containernumber(1234)


from starting first line to 26th lines steps all we done for HTTPD 

Now we will do same procedure for NGINX as well

go to home giving command as cd enter

make one folder here 
name it as version-2e-com-app
mkdir version-2-ecom-app
go to that created folder 
cd version-2-ecom-app
create two files here 
1. file for source code name it as index.html
2. file for Dockerfil name it as Dockerfile

vim index.html
paste here the source code

vim Dockerfile 
FROM nginx
LABEL this is version-2-ecom-app image
MAINTAINER name pranay
EXPOSE 80
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
(/usr/share/nginx/html------------->nginx default path)

docker build -t myapp:v2 .

docker run -itd --name v2-cont -p 1111:80 myapp:v2
copy the public IP of ec2-instance and paste in new tab as public IP:1111 ---------> to access the application with ec2-instance publicIP:containernumber(1111)


Now we will do for python application

go to home giving command as cd enter

make one folder here 
name it as python-app
mkdir python-app
go to that created folder 
cd python-app
create three files here 
1. file for source code name it as app.py
2. for requiremetns.py------> for for python dependencices developers will give this code
3. file for Dockerfil name it as Dockerfile

vim app.py
paste here the source code

in vim requiremetns.py
paste this 3 lines below and save it


vim requiremetns.py
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.0.0
plotly>=5.17.0

paste and save it

vim Dockerfile
FROM python:3
WORKDIR /myapp
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY app.py ./
EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]


docker build -t pyapp:v2 .
docker run -itd --name pycont4 -p 8503:8501 pyapp:v2

build the Dockerfile 
image will be created
run the image container will be created 
access the application with publicIP:containernumber
